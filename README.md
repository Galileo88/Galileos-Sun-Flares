# Galileo's Sun Flares 
For KSP v1.3.1

**This version includes:**
* 3 brand new sun flares, with red, white, and blue variations. 
* Every sun flare includes immersive dust particles on the lenses. Not sure if its possible, but it looks cool.
* The sun flares are now individually packaged to cut down on download size tremendously. 
* The sun flares no longer overwrite Scatterer's default textures, instead everything is implemented through Module manager.

**TO INSTALL:**

* **Download and install Scatterer**
* **Drop the GSF folder into your GameData folder**
